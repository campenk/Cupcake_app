## Overview
Gym membership application created in C# in Visual Studio for BIT603 Programming II.
## Requirements
The store ‘Kiwi Cookies and Cakes’ would like an Android app with a complete log-in system that has the ability to create new users, storing these users in a database that is then used to perform the validation for logging in. For now, storing the database information insecurely is sufficient; a future update can handle security improvements. Additionally, they would like the inventory management system to be updated to allow more information about the product to be stored, in addition to quantity they would like to include what type of product it is (Biscuit, Cookie, Cake, Ingredient, or Other). The user should be able to add new items into the inventory and query this information as a report.
